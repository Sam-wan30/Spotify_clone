# Spotify_clone
ðŸŽ¶ Spotify Clone â€“ A simple web-based clone of Spotifyâ€™s UI built using HTML &amp; CSS. Includes sidebar navigation, library section, playlist cards, and a sticky bottom music player. Built as part of my #100DaysOfCode (Day 18) challenge to strengthen frontend development skills.
